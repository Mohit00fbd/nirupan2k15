                <p>Allahabad University is one of the oldest universities of India which stands for more than a century as a witness of building of the Indian nation. Set with an endeavour to impart quality education and promote all-round development, the university offers more than 70 courses.</p>
                <p>A new dimension was added to it on August 27, 2010 with the inauguration of <strong>Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Hostel</strong>. In the backdrop of acute shortage of accomodation for the students of professional studies, our hostel was a welcome relief. Our hostel is special because last time the authority of Allahabad University laid foundation stone of our hostel meant for boys was in 1987(for Shatabdi Boys Hostel). The hostel is named after the eminent teacher, most influential scholar of philosophy and the second President of India. The first phase of hostel was inaugurated by <em>Professor R.J. HARSHE</em>, the then Vice-Chancellor of Allahabad University and <em>Professor J.A. ANSARI</em> was appointed the first warden. The second phase of the hostel was inaugurated by the present Vice-Chancellor,<em> Professor A.K. Singh</em> on February 28<sup>th</sup> 2012. There are about <strong>220 single-seated</strong> and <strong>26 double-seated</strong> rooms, residents of which have been with all modern facilities.</p>
                <p>The ground floor has a used dining area and student's mess to<strong>enhance the social quotient</strong> of the inmates. <h3>The first floor has recreational rooms like:<div class="highlights"></h3><div class="highlights"><ul><li>Reading Room</li><li>A Common Room with Television</li><li>Separate Computer Room</li><li>Chess</li>
                <li>Table Tennis Room</li></ul>
                </div>
                The second floor has a <strong>gymnasium</strong> to ensure the physical fitness of its inmates. The second and the thord floor are fully for residential purposes. The students are provided with <strong>fully furnished rooms</strong> including bed, cupboard, chair, table and <em>high-speed internet connection</em> in every room. The hostel presently has around 300 inmates from <strong>J.K. Institute of Applied Physics and Technology, Institute of Professional Studies, Monirba and Bachelor of Arts, B.A. L.L.B.(Hons.)</strong>. Apart from academic activities, there are tournaments of chess, table-tennis, badminton, volleyball and cricket. And in this year 2015, for the third time the academic, co-curricular activities are being moduled together in an organised grand frame <q><strong>NIRUPAN 2015</strong></q>. Inspite of the fact that our hostel is only 5 years old, many inmates from different courses have written their success stories with golden letters that will act as inviting vistas of inspiration for others to follow.
